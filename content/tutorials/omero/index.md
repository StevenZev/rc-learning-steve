OMERO is image management software that allows you to organize, view, annotate, analyze, and share your data from a single centralized repository. 

This tutorial describes the first steps to get started with UVA's OMERO database. Instructions include how to connect to OMERO, import images, organize and tag images, and provides links to other tutorials describing the use of OMERO with third-party software such as Fiji/ImageJ, MATLAB&trade;, and Python.
