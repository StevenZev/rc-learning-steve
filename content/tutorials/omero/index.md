OMERO is image management software that allows you to organize, view, annotate, analyze, and share your data from a single centralized repository. 

"This hands-on tutorial will show you how to import images into the OMERO database, organize and tag images, and how to use OMERO with third-party software such as Fiji/ImageJ, MATLAB&trade;, and Python."

Download the sample dataset and scripts so you can follow along with the
examples.
