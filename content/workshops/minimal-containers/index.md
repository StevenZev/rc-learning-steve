title: Minimal Containers
summary: "The industry standard of restricting containers to just the application and its dependencies often results in better security and smaller size. See how the use of multi-stage builds and scratch/distroless base images can reduce the image size by as much as 99% in real applications. This is a continuation of the Building Containers for Rivanna workshop."
