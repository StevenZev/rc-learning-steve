Julia is a high-level programming language designed for high-performance numerical analysis and computational science. Distinctive aspects of Julia's design include a type system with parametric polymorphism and types in a fully dynamic programming language and multiple dispatch as its core programming paradigm. It allows concurrent, parallel and distributed computing, and direct calling of C and Fortran libraries without glue code. A just-in-time compiler that is referred to as "just-ahead-of-time" in the Julia community is used.

The code examples in this workshop are meant for running Julia on the Rivanna cluster. Attendees will be able to ask questions and receive feedback regarding workshop exercises during the Q&A session.  Users will also have the opportunity to run MATLAB code on the Rivanna cluster if they have login accounts, otherwise they will be given training accounts on the cluster.
