Deep Learning is a technique that enables machines to learn using multilayered neural
networks. This hands-on tutorial will show you how to classify images with a pretrained
neural network, modify a pretrained network to classify images into new specified classes,
and build a neural network from scratch.  Please download the slides and the zip file containing the sample datasets and scripts in order to follow along.
