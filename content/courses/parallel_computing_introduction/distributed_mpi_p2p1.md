In point-to-point communications, individual processes send and receive messages directly to and from other processes.

A _send_ can be
* Synchronous or asynchronous
* Buffered or unbuffered
* Sent to a particular destination

A _receive_ can be
* Blocking or non-blocking
* Buffered or non-buffered
* Received from a particular source, or from any source
