This short course is an introduction to the Python programming language for beginners.  No previous experience with programming is required.

Learning to program requires practice and patience.  You cannot learn by watching videos or even reading notes with examples.  You should attempt all the examples throughout this course.  Resist the urge to peek at the solutions as long as you can.  Work throught at least a few of the Projects for each section.

When the course is being offered live the project sample solutions may be unavailable: try them yourself anyway, and return when the solutions are posted again.

Once you have mastered programming in Python, you may find that your scripts are slow.  We offer a course in [High-Performance Python](/notes/python_high_perf) to help you learn to optimize your code.
