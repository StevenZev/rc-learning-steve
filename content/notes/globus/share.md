Globus users are able to share data with anyone with a Globus account. All UVA Rivanna and Ivy users have Globus accounts (authenticate with Netbadge).

External collaborators don’t need to be affiliated with an institution using Globus in order for you to share data with them. Anyone can create a personal Globus account using @globusid.org

The following video and instructions show how to create a **shared endpoint**, a folder in which collaborators can upload and download data. Shared endpoints may be public (visible to the world!) or accessible only to users with permission.
