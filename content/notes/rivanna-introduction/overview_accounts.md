* Allocations and Groups
    * An allocation is associated with a _group_.  Currently this is a [MyGroups](https://mygroups.virginia.edu) group.
    * Members (but not administrators) of the allocation group automatically receive an account on Rivanna.
    * RC staff do not manage allocation groups.  The PI is responsible for adding and removing group members.  
    * The PI may designate administrators and delegate the task of managing the group to them.
