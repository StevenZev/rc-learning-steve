The following links are to the MathWork's Matlab Academy online courses in data science.
The first link, "Matlab Onramp", is a quick introduction to Matlab for those who have not used it before.
The next two links are introductions to machine learning and deep learning using Matlab.
The 4th and 5th links are in-depth courses in machine learning and deep learning using Matlab.
The last link is to a video of using Matlab for data analytics. Next to each section is an
estimate of the of the amount of time it would take to go through the material in the corresponding link.
