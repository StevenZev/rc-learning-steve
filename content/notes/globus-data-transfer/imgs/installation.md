**Instructions**

1. Open the Globus Application and click “Log In”
2. Choose “University of Virginia” and log in using Netbadge
3. Choose a label for consent and click “Allow”. (The label you choose doesn't really matter.)
4. Choose a name for your Personal Collection. This is the name that you will see in the Globus collections list, so choose something descriptive enough that you know what it is and can quickly find it by searching (e.g. Martinez-Lab-Workstation, Zhang-Personal-Laptop).
5. **Do NOT click the High Assurance checkbox!** The UVA Secure Data Transfer Node is already configured for sensitive data transfer. Checking the box is redundant conflicts with the default configuration.
6. Click "Save" then "Exit Setup".
