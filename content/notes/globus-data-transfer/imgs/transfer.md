Files are transferred with the Globus File Manager Web App. There are three ways to get to the app:

1. Go straight to https://app.globus.org/file-manager
2. Go to https://www.globus.org/ -> Log In (top right corner)
3. Click Globus icon in Toolbar -> Web: Transfer Files

Once the app is open you can choose the collections between which you wish transfer data, as detailed in the video and instructions below.

**Instructions**

1. Click the “Collection” field.
2. Click the “Your Collections” tab.
3. Select your Personal Collection.
4. Click “Transfer or Sync to…” in the gray menu.
5. Click the second “Collection” field.
6. Search for and select “UVA Standard Security Storage” or “UVA IVY-DTN”.
7. Select the files or folders you want to transfer.
8. Select the destination for your files.
9. Click the highlighted “Start” button.

### Transfer Options

- By default, transfers on UVA DTNs are synced (option 1) and encrypted (option 5) – no need to select them.
- Files with errors will cause entire transfer to fail – skip files with errors instead (option 6).
- Schedule one-time and regular transfers with Timer.
