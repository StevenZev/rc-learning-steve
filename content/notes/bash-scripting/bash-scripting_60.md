[a-zA-Z] matches any letter

[^a-z] matches anything  _except_  lower-case letters

.all matches all, call, ball, mall, and so forth.  Also matches shall (since it contains hall).

Regex patterns are said to be  _greedy_  since they find a match with the most generous interpretation of the pattern.
