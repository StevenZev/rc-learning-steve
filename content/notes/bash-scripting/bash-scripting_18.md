* The conditions take different forms depending on what you want to compare.
* String comparison operators:
  * = 		equal
  * != 		not equal
  * <		lexically before (may need to be escaped)
  * > 		lexically after (may need to be escaped)
  * -z		zero length
  * -n		not zero length
  * == 		can be used but behaves differently in [] versus [[]]
