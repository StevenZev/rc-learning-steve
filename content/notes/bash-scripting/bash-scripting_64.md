* sed operates on standard input and outputs to stdout unless told otherwise.  Thus you must redirect.
* The -i option will tell it to overwrite the old file.  This is often a mistake (if you do this, be sure to debug the sed command carefully first).
* sed 'command' < old > new
  * Note hard quotesâ€”best practice is to use them
* sed 's/day/night/' < old > new
  * Remember, expressions are  _greedy_ ; day/night here changes Sunday to Sunnight
