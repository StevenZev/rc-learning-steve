This tutorial is an introduction to scripting the bash shell.  We assume an understanding of using the [bash shell](/tutorials/unix-tutorials) from the command line on a Unix (Linux or MacOS) system.

MacOS has recently changed its default shell from bash to `zsh`.  Mac users can find zsh tutorials such as [this](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Guide/zshguide.html). The z shell is quite similar to bash and the programming languages for the two shells are nearly identical.
