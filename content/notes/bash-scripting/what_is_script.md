A _bash script_ is a plain-text file that contains instructions in the _bash programming language_ for the computer to execute.  Scripts are interpreted at runtime and executed line-by-line.  Scripts are not standalone executables but must be run through an _interpreter_.  For bash scripts, the bash shell itself is the interpreter.

Anything that can be executed or evaluated on the bash command line can be placed into a script.

Bash scripts are frequently used to automate repetitive tasks such as file handling and data backups.  When combined with Slurm it can also be used to set up computing jobs on a Linux-based cluster, such as UVAâ€™s Rivanna High-Performance Computing cluster.
