* Regular expressions are generalizations of the wildcards often used for simple file commands.
* A regular expression consists of a pattern that attempts to match text.
* It contains one or more of:
  * A character set
  * An anchor (to the line position)
  * Modifiers
* Without an anchor or repeat it will find the  _leftmost_  match and stop.
