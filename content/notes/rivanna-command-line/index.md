title: "Using Rivanna from the Command Line"
---
This workshop provides an introduction to the command-line interface. We’ll learn how to use commands to perform basic operations in the terminal — creating or navigating directories, listing and displaying files, moving or copying files — as well as searching files, managing file permissions, and creating symbolic links. Working in the command line, we can combine existing programs, automate repetitive tasks, and connect to remote resources
