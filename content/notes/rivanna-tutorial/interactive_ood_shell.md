A graphical user interface is useful, but on a system like Rivanna, eventually we must learn a little about the command line.  Open OnDemand provides a simple terminal application.

`Clusters->_Rivanna Shell Access` opens a tab with a terminal application running.

You should be automatically logged in to a Rivanna frontend.

A limitation of the Open OnDemand shell is that you cannot run graphical applications through it.  If you need to start a program with a graphical user interface, use FastX.
