Currently the Rivanna supercomputer has 603 nodes with over 20476 cores and 8PB of various storage.

Several queues (or “partitions”) are availble to users for different types of jobs. One queue is restricted to single-node (serial or threaded) jobs; another for multinode parallel programs, and others are for access to specialty hardware such as large-memory nodes or nodes offering GPUs.
