Log in to Rivanna through the Open OnDemand portal. Examine the menus. Starting from the Interactive Apps menu, log in to FastX (VPN required).  Once on the desktop, click the square black icon in the ribbon in the upper left to start a Terminal window; alternatively, go the menu Applications->System Tools and click on MATE Terminal.  In the terminal, list all `matlab` modules.  Choose a version and load the module.  Check which module you have loaded.  Purge the module.
